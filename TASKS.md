## Task Prioritization Guidelines

### Critical Path Items
1. MLX setup and optimization
2. Consciousness architecture
3. Compression implementation
4. BLT byte processing
5. Web connectivity
6. Self-training capability

### Parallel Development
- Consciousness alongside core ML
- Compression with storage design
- Web features with RAG
- Documentation during implementation

### Dependencies
- Consciousness needs core architecture
- Compression requires storage design
- Web intelligence needs RAG
- Advanced features need consciousness

## Notes
- Focus on consciousness implementation early
- Prioritize compression for laptop constraints
- Maintain web connectivity throughout
- Test consciousness regularly
- Document all compression ratios
- Keep focus on M4 Pro optimization
