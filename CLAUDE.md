            narrative = self.stream_processor.generate()
            
            # Self-reflection
            reflection = self.reflect_on_state()
            
            # Update self-model
            self.phenomenal_model.update(narrative, reflection)
            
            # Store conscious experience
            self.store_experience(narrative, reflection)

        async for update in self.web_stream():
            processed = await self.process_web_data(update)
            compressed = self.compress_for_storage(processed)
            await self.integrate_knowledge(compressed)
