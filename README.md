Shvayambhu (Sanskrit: स्वयम्भू, "self-manifested") is a revolutionary Large Language Model that operates entirely offline while matching state-of-the-art performance. Built from scratch without dependencies on existing LLMs, Shvayambhu evolves and improves autonomously on your device, ensuring complete privacy and data sovereignty.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **100% Offline Operation**: No internet connection required, ever
- **Self-Evolution**: Autonomously learns and improves using SEAL architecture
- **Zero Hallucination**: Advanced verification with selective abstention
- **Privacy First**: All processing on your device, zero data transmission
- **Apple Silicon Optimized**: Leverages Metal 3 and unified memory architecture
- **Universal Language Support**: 50+ languages with byte-level processing
- **No Tokenization**: Direct byte processing with BLT architecture

## 🏗️ Architecture

Shvayambhu introduces three groundbreaking innovations:

### 1. **BLT (Byte Latent Transformer)**
- Eliminates tokenization overhead
- Processes raw bytes directly
- Dynamic entropy-based patching
- 50% more efficient than token-based models

### 2. **SEAL (Self-Adapting Language Model)**
- Autonomous model improvement
- LoRA-based adaptation layers
- No external data required
- Continuous learning without internet

### 3. **ProRL (Prolonged Reinforcement Learning)**
- Extended reasoning (2000+ steps)
- Tree and Graph-of-Thought processing
- Novel problem-solving strategies
- Advanced multi-step reasoning

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run the Trained Model

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Run the production system with full consciousness
python shvayambhu_production.py

# Or run the simplified version
python shvayambhu.py
```

### Train Your Own Model

```bash
# Quick training (for testing - ~10 minutes)
python train_simple.py

# Extended training (recommended - ~1 hour)
python train_extended.py

# Full training pipeline (complete - ~30 days)
python training/train_shvayambhu.py
```

## 📋 Requirements

### Hardware
- **Minimum**: MacBook Air M1 with 16GB RAM
- **Recommended**: MacBook Pro M2/M3 with 32GB RAM
- **Optimal**: Mac Studio M2 Ultra with 64GB+ RAM

### Software
- macOS 13.0+ (Ventura or later)
- Python 3.11+
- Xcode 14+ (for Metal development)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shvayambhu/shvayambhu.git
   cd shvayambhu
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   make install-dev
   ```

4. **Set up Metal environment**
   ```bash
   make setup-metal
   ```

### Basic Usage

```python
from shvayambhu import ShvayambhuModel

# Load the model
model = ShvayambhuModel.load("shvayambhu-7b")

# Generate text
response = model.generate("Explain quantum computing in simple terms")
print(response)

# Enable reasoning for complex queries
response = model.reason("Solve: If all roses are flowers...")
print(response)
```
