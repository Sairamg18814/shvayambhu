## What is Shvayambhu?

**Shvayambhu** (Sanskrit: ‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§Ø‡§Æ‡•ç‡§≠‡•Ç, "self-manifested") is a revolutionary Large Language Model that operates entirely offline while matching state-of-the-art performance. Built from scratch without dependencies on existing LLMs, Shvayambhu evolves and improves autonomously on your device, ensuring complete privacy and data sovereignty.

## Key Features

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :rocket: **100% Offline Operation**  
  No internet connection required, ever. All processing happens on your device.

- :brain: **Self-Evolution**  
  Autonomously learns and improves using our SEAL architecture without external data.

- :shield: **Zero Hallucination**  
  Advanced verification with selective abstention ensures reliable outputs.

- :lock: **Privacy First**  
  All processing on your device with zero data transmission.

- :zap: **Apple Silicon Optimized**  
  Leverages Metal 3 and unified memory architecture for blazing performance.

- :globe_with_meridians: **Universal Language Support**  
  50+ languages with byte-level processing, no tokenization needed.

## Quick Start

```python
from shvayambhu import ShvayambhuModel

# Load the model
model = ShvayambhuModel.load("shvayambhu-7b")

# Generate text
response = model.generate("Explain quantum computing in simple terms")
print(response)

# Enable reasoning for complex queries
response = model.reason("Solve: If all roses are flowers...")
print(response)
```

## Architecture Overview

Shvayambhu introduces three groundbreaking innovations:

### 1. BLT (Byte Latent Transformer)
- Eliminates tokenization overhead
- Processes raw bytes directly
- Dynamic entropy-based patching
- 50% more efficient than token-based models

### 2. SEAL (Self-Adapting Language Model)
- Autonomous model improvement
- LoRA-based adaptation layers
- No external data required
- Continuous learning without internet

### 3. ProRL (Prolonged Reinforcement Learning)
- Extended reasoning (2000+ steps)
- Tree and Graph-of-Thought processing
- Novel problem-solving strategies
- Advanced multi-step reasoning
