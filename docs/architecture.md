# Architecture Overview

This document provides a detailed overview of Shvayambhu's architecture.

## System Architecture

Shvayambhu consists of four main components working in harmony:

### 1. BLT (Byte Latent Transformer)
The foundation of our tokenization-free approach.

### 2. SEAL (Self-Adapting Language Model) 
Enables autonomous improvement without external data.

### 3. ProRL (Prolonged Reinforcement Learning)
Provides advanced reasoning capabilities.

### 4. Safety Systems
Ensures reliable, hallucination-free outputs.

## Data Flow

1. Input bytes are processed by BLT encoder
2. Latent representations flow through transformer layers
3. SEAL adaptations are applied as needed
4. ProRL handles complex reasoning tasks
5. Safety checks verify output quality
6. BLT decoder produces final byte sequence

## Hardware Optimization

All components are optimized for Apple Silicon's unified memory architecture and Metal Performance Shaders.
