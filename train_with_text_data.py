        "Human: What is DNA?\nAssistant: DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is the hereditary material in humans and almost all other organisms. It contains the genetic instructions for development and function.",
        "Human: Explain photosynthesis.\nAssistant: Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to create oxygen and energy in the form of sugar.",
        "Human: What causes rain?\nAssistant: Rain occurs when water vapor in clouds condenses into water droplets that become heavy enough to fall to Earth due to gravity.",

        "Human: Create a metaphor for learning.\nAssistant: Learning is like tending a garden - you plant seeds of knowledge, nurture them with practice, and watch understanding bloom.",
        "Human: Describe the internet creatively.\nAssistant: The internet is a vast digital ocean where streams of information flow like currents, connecting islands of human knowledge.",
